# Help Hub

A small static site offering mental health tips and links to support services.

## Project Overview 

Help Hub is a simple, responsive static website built with HTML and Bootstrap to provide practical mental health tips and signpost services and support.

## Features

- Responsive layout using Bootstrap 5
- Sections for tips, services, and contact
- Accessible markup with ARIA attributes
- Simple footer with social links

## Wireframes

Before starting the project, I created wireframes for different viewports to help visualise how I wanted the site to look on different devices. This helped me with creating a responsive site.

I used the software _Balsamiq_, to create these diagrams.

## Development

This project was deployed using GitHub Pages.

To deploy the site, I followed these steps:

Pushed the final version of the project to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
Navigated to the repository's Settings tab.
Scrolled down to the Pages section in the left-hand menu.
Under Source, selected the main branch and set the root folder (/) as the source.
GitHub Pages automatically built and deployed the project.
After a few moments, a banner appeared at the top of the Pages section with the live site link.

The live website is available here:
