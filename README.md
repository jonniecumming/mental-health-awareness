## Wireframes

Before starting the project, I created wireframes for different viewports to help visualise how I wanted the site to look on different devices. This helped me with creating a responsive site.

I used the software _Balsamiq_, to create these diagrams.

## Development

This project was deployed using GitHub Pages.

To deploy the site, I followed these steps:

Pushed the final version of the project to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
Navigated to the repository's Settings tab.
Scrolled down to the Pages section in the left-hand menu.
Under Source, selected the main branch and set the root folder (/) as the source.
GitHub Pages automatically built and deployed the project.
After a few moments, a banner appeared at the top of the Pages section with the live site link.

The live website is available here:

## Reflection
### Challenges
From starting the development of the fundementals layout of the site whilst being uncertain about variuous elements, I created many unneccessary problems for myself. This was especially unhelpful when getting used to using a standardised apporach to building a site as it meant I was often doping things in a sub-optimal way in terms of order, as well as efficieny.
### What I have learned
From doing this project, I have learned that having a strong idea from the beginning is vital to setting yorself up to develop a site in a clean and clear manner. Having a fully-thought-through use alongside carefully considered user stories helps give the design process clarity, which makes the process much easier, and in turn, saves time and money, potentially. 

### Future Improvements
- Further refinement of responsive design
- Add a contact form for users to contact for guidance
- More visually interactive/attractive elements
